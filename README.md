# Angular Master Class

This repository contains the **Lab Descriptions** for the Angular Master Class JumpStart courseware. 

## Web and App Servers

To launch your web application, use a Terminal session with the command:

```
$ ng serve
```

This starts a web server for the Angular 2 application; open with a browser url `http://localhost:4200`.

And since your Angular application may request external, remote data [from `http://localhost:4201/api`], you will need a local app server to respond to the REST API calls. We have already configured a server as part of this repository.

Simply start a second, separate Terminal session with the commend:

```
$ npm run rest-api
```

## Important Message

Remember: never be afraid to ask questions! The **thoughtram** trainers love questions. 

> Often your question - and the answers - are very important to other students in the class. 

And finally, help each other. Helping other students will reinforce the ideas that you are learning in this lesson... Have fun and good luck!
